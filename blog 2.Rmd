# Date story 1


```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/owid-covid-data.csv")
dat$date = as.Date(dat$date, "%Y-%m-%d")
```

```{r}
rou <- dat %>% 
  select(iso_code,
         location,
         date,
         total_cases,
         new_cases,
         total_deaths,
         new_deaths,
         total_vaccinations,
         total_tests) %>% 
  filter(iso_code == "ROU")
```

The tables below show the date, the total number of cases, the number of new cases per day, the total number of deaths, the number of new deaths per day, the total number of vaccinations and the total number of COVID-19 tests respectively. In the table, you can find the data you want for a specific date.

These data were recorded from 26 February 2020 and collected up to 29 August 2021 (the most recent). As you can see from the table, the highest number of new confirmed cases on a single day was on 18 November 2020, with 10,269 cases, and the highest number of new deaths on a single day was on 29 June 2021, with 294 cases.

```{r}
rou1 <- rou %>% 
  select(-iso_code,
         -location)
DT::datatable(rou1, options = list(pageLength = 5), caption = "Romania Daily COVID19 Case") %>% 
  formatStyle(
  'new_cases',
  target = 'row',
  backgroundColor = styleEqual(10269, "#7cddff")) %>% 
  formatStyle(
  'new_deaths',
  target = 'row',
  backgroundColor = styleEqual(294, "#96b1ff"))
```

![](Romania1.jpg){width=50}

```{r}
rou_dy <- rou %>%
  select(date, new_cases, new_deaths)


rou_dy1 <- rou_dy %>%
  xts(order.by = rou_dy$date)

dygraph(rou_dy1, main = "The daily cases and deaths") %>%
  dyAxis("y",label = "new cases") %>%
  dyAxis("y2", label = "new deaths") %>%
  dySeries("new_cases", 
           axis = "y", 
           label = "New cases",
           stepPlot = TRUE, 
           fillGraph = TRUE, 
           color = "blue") %>%
  dySeries("new_deaths", 
           axis = "y2", 
           stepPlot = TRUE, 
           color = "red") %>%
  dyOptions(includeZero = TRUE, 
            axisLineColor = "navy", 
            gridLineColor = "lightblue") %>%
  dyRangeSelector() %>%
  dyHighlight(highlightCircleSize = 5, 
              highlightSeriesBackgroundAlpha = 0.2,
              hideOnMouseOut = FALSE) %>%
  dyLegend(show = "always", hideOnMouseOut = FALSE)
```

As can be seen from the graph above, after 25 March 2021, the number of new cases per day starts to fall, proving that Romania has contained the spread of the epidemic, and also that after 7 July 2021, the number of new deaths per day falls, proving that the vaccine is working and that Romania has effectively contained the virus from harming people.


```{r}
rou_v <- dat %>% 
  select(iso_code,
         location,
         date,
         people_vaccinated,
         people_fully_vaccinated) %>% 
  filter(iso_code == "ROU")
rou_v[is.na(rou_v)] <- 0
```

```{r}
rou_v1 <- rou_v %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-iso_code,
                        -location,
                        -date),
               names_to = "type",
               values_to = "count") %>% 
  select(-iso_code,
         -location)
```


```{r}
ggplot(rou_v1, aes(x = date, 
                 y = count,
                 group = type, 
                 color = type)) +
    geom_line() +
    scale_color_viridis(discrete = TRUE) +
    ggtitle("Vaccination in Romania") +
    theme_ipsum() +
    ylab("Number of vaccinations")
```


As you can see from the graph above, the number of people getting vaccinated is on the rise, with people starting to get vaccinated from January 2021 onwards, and a proportion of people starting to get their second dose around February 2021. By August 2021, nearly a quarter of the country's population will have been vaccinated.


# Date story 2

```{r}
c <- dat %>% 
  select(iso_code,
         location,
         date,
         total_cases) %>% 
  filter(iso_code %in% c("SGP",
                         "ROU"))
```

```{r}
ggplot(c, aes(x = date, y = total_cases, fill = location))+
  geom_area()+
  facet_wrap(~location, scales = "free")+
  scale_fill_brewer(labels = c("Total number of confirmed cases in Singapore",
                               "Total number of confirmed cases in Romania"),
                    palette = "Set1")+
  theme_bw()+
  geom_hline(yintercept = 70, linetype="dotted")+
  labs(title = "",
       x = "",
       y = "Number of peopel",
       fill = "")+
  theme(legend.position = "bottom") +
  transition_reveal(date)
```

As you can see in the graph above, the number of confirmed cases in Singapore starts to rise around March 2020, and by around May 2020, the number of confirmed cases starts to rise sharply until around September 2020 when the upward trend starts to slow down. In Romania, on the other hand, the number of confirmed diagnoses starts to rise slowly around April 2020 and only starts to accelerate around October 2020. The upward trend continues until around June 2021, when it slows down.

As we can see from the units on the y-axis, the number of confirmed cases in Romania is much larger than the number of confirmed cases in Singapore, which factors in the difference in the total population, but in terms of percentage, Singapore has much better control of the epidemic than Romania. In addition, the difference in policy between the two countries is a result of the fact that Singapore has a quarantine policy, whereas Romania, like other European countries, has a herd immunisation policy. This is why the above results were obtained.
