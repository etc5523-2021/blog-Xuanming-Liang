# Analysis & Summary

Here are some relevant data on COVID-19 in Singapore, including total (new) cases per day, total (new) deaths per day, the total number of people tested and the total number of people vaccinated. 

```{r}
dat <- read.csv("data/owid-covid-data.csv")
```

```{r}
sg <- dat %>% 
  select(iso_code,
         location,
         date,
         total_cases,
         new_cases,
         total_deaths,
         new_deaths,
         total_vaccinations,
         total_tests,
         population) %>% 
  filter(iso_code == "SGP")
```

```{r}
sg1 <- sg %>% 
  select(-iso_code,
         -location,
         -population)
DT::datatable(sg1, options = list(pageLength = 5), caption = "Singapore Daily COVID19 Case")
```

The above tables show the date, the total number of cases, the number of new cases per day, the total number of deaths, the number of new deaths per day, the total number of vaccinations and the total number of COVID-19 tests respectively. Due to individual data not being collected on a daily basis for a reason, the data collected contains unknown values, all unknown values will not be shown and will be blank. In the table, you can find data on the number of new cases or deaths for the specific date you want.

The data was collected from the 23rd of January 2020, when records were started, until the 29th of August 2021 (the most recent). As can be seen from the table, the highest number of new confirmed cases in a single day was on 20 April 2020, with 1,426 cases, and the highest number of new deaths in a single day was 3, on 28 August 2021.

```{r}
options(digits = 3)
summ1 <- sg %>% 
  filter(date == "2021-08-29") %>% 
  mutate("Mortality rate" = total_deaths/total_cases*100,
         "Confirmation rate" = total_cases/population*100) %>% 
  select(date,
         'Mortality rate',
         'Confirmation rate')  


summ1_p <- summ1 %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = -date,
               names_to = "Issue",
               values_to = "Percentage(%)") 

kable(summ1_p)
```

As of 29 August 2021, the national diagnosis rate of COVID-19 in Singapore is 1.139% and the mortality rate is 0.082%, which is a testament to the success of Singapore's efforts to combat the epidemic.

# Conclusion

The impact of the COVID-19 outbreak has closed schools, closed shops and damaged the economy, while people's lives are at risk. During this difficult time, we hope that we can all work together to overcome the situation, monitor the situation and take precautions. Let's hope for a better tomorrow!
