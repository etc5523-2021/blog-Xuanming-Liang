sg <- dat %>% 
  select(iso_code,
         location,
         date,
         total_cases,
         new_cases,
         total_deaths,
         new_deaths,
         total_vaccinations,
         total_tests) %>% 
  filter(iso_code == "SGP")
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
sg1 <- sg %>% 
  select(-iso_code,
         -location)
DT::datatable(sg1, options = list(pageLength = 5), caption = "Singapore Daily COVID19 Case")
